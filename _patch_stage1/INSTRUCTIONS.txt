Patch Stage 1 — Clean Forms & UI (Drop-in)

Files included:
- templates/base.html
- templates/register_purchase.html
- templates/register_sale.html
- static/css/styles.css
- static/js/form-common.js

How to apply:
1) Backup your current templates/static.
2) Copy the provided files into your Django app where your templates/static are served.
   - Ensure STATIC_URL and STATICFILES_DIRS are configured.
3) Make sure your view passes `form` and `op_type` context OR use these wrappers:
   - register_purchase.html uses `{% with op_type='خرید' %}` and expects a form with fields:
     party, item, date_shamsi, quantity, unit_price, total_price, note
   - register_sale.html same as above
4) After successful POST, redirect to the same view with `?ok=1` to show a toast and reset.
5) For recent rows AJAX:
   - When query param `?recent=N` is present and X-Requested-With is XMLHttpRequest,
     return only `tx_table_body.html` snippet for the N latest records of that op_type.

Notes:
- Numbers are kept in EN digits during typing; formatting with commas on blur only (no Persian-digit conversion while typing).
- In فروش, total is read-only and = qty × unit; in خرید, total is editable and unit is recalculated.
